        <h1 id="spatial-computation">Spatial Computation</h1>
        <div class="published">Published on Juin 23, 2022</div>
        <h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
        <p class="block">Research and development in the field of spatial computing aims to make it possible for people and robots to move around actual or virtual environments. It consists of Automated Vehicles, Computer Vision, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Sensor Technology and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <h3 id="i-ndustries-">I<strong>ndustries:</strong></h3>
        <p class="block">Due to spatial computing, seven industry sectors—transportation, technology, entertainment, manufacturing, retail, healthcare, finance and education—will undergo significant change.</p>
        <h3 id="p-otential-">P<strong>otential:</strong></h3>
        <p class="block">From 2D to 3D, the 2020s will see a perfect storm of change. We anticipate that computing will shift away from staring into a four-inch piece of glass in our hands and toward using devices on our faces that bring computing to every surface. Along with that, we will witness advancements such as vehicles moving without humans for the first time. Spatial Computing is the fourth paradigm of the personal computing age, and it truly makes personal computers more personal.</p>
        <h3 id="-paradigms-"><strong>Paradigms:</strong></h3>
        <p class="block">According to experts Robert Scoble and Irena Cronin there are 4 paradigms of computing:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The Arrival of the Personal Computer</li>
        <li>Graphical Interfaces and Thinking</li>
        <li>Mobile</li>
        <li>Spatial Computing with its two purest members, Virtual and Augmented Reality</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="t-echnologies-">T<strong>echnologies:</strong></h3>
        <p>Pushing forward spatial computation requires 6 main technologies:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Optics and Displays</li>
        <li>Wireless and Communications</li>
        <li>Control Mechanisms (Voice, Eyes, and Hands)</li>
        <li>Sensors and Mapping</li>
        <li>Computing Architectures</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence (Decision Systems)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="-vision-"><strong>Vision:</strong></h3>
        <p class="block">In the book The Infinite Retina we see mention of 7 important visions for spatial computation (I recommend reading the book for more in depth information)</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p class="li_title"><strong>Transportation Automates</strong> </p>
        <p> We will soon summon vehicles that will arrive without humans. This will have far-reaching consequences for humans, as well as the cities and infrastructure we rely on. They will also collect data that will allow us to see ourselves differently as well as develop new services that may affect everything from how we eat out to how we shop and find other services.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="li_title"><strong>Virtual Worlds Appear</strong> </p>
        <p> Because of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, new realities are emerging. However, in a few years, the capabilities of VR and AR will change and morph into more sophisticated Spatial Computing glasses, which will arrive with massive increases in bandwidth thanks to 5G and new AI capabilities, thanks in part to autonomous vehicle research and development.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="li_title"><strong>Augmented Manufacturing</strong></p>
        <p> The upcoming changes will be drastic. A new type of manufacturing is on the way, one in which humans remain involved, but with new virtual interfaces to machines and new AI assisting in the work.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="li_title"><strong>Robot Consumers</strong></p>
        <p> Retail continues to define the face of America, and indeed the entire world, as evidenced by visits to small town or big city malls, whether in Chicago or Dubai. However, that face will soon change dramatically as tons of new technology is introduced into all aspects of the retail world, from robots to Spatial Computing glasses that consumers will use to shop in new ways.</p>
        <aside>
        At <a href="https://omerva.tn"><b>omerva</b></a> we are working to achieve this vision through our project <strong>“omarket”</strong>

        </aside>
        </li>
        <li><p class="li_title"><strong>Virtual Healthcare</strong></p>
        <p> When we imagine a world in which every doctor, nurse, administrator, and patient wears Spatial Computing glasses, we see five changes: the medical system becomes more efficient, existing patient care improves, those providing medical care are better trained, the patient experience improves, and healthcare becomes more predictive and personalized.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="li_title"><strong>Virtual Trading and Banking</strong></p>
        <p> However, the use of spatial computing in the financial sector is currently very minimal. The main causes of this are the industry&#39;s inherent conservatism and the sheer volume of laws relating to trading and customer interfaces that would need to be addressed. I think that the financial sector will incorporate spatial computing&#39;s technologies wholeheartedly in the future due to the multiple advantages that it might provide.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="li_title"><strong>Real-Time Learning</strong></p>
        <p> Virtual and augmented reality are already being adopted in educational settings and corporate training. Many people tell that these technologies can offer the same, if not superior, learning.</p>
        </li>
